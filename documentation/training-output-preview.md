## Ranking Summary

| Rank | Student | Score | Category | Key Factor |
|------|---------|-------|----------|------------|
| 1 | Sudeep | 0.73 | Strong | Exceptional study routine + skills |
| 2 | Arun | 0.70 | Strong | Strong academics + projects |
| 2 | Vivek | 0.70 | Strong | Upward trend + projects |
| 4 | Mayur | 0.68 | Good | Low confidence is blocker |

## Common Patterns Identified

### Strengths Across All Students:
- ✅ All have 3-5 projects (good portfolio)
- ✅ All are Computer Science majors (high demand)
- ✅ All have decent technical skills
- ✅ All are in final year (ready for placement)

### Common Gaps:
- ⚠️ High screen time (5-6h/day) - affects productivity
- ⚠️ Irregular sleep schedules - impacts performance
- ⚠️ Low confidence/high interview fear - placement blocker
- ⚠️ Limited internship experience (only 2/4 have internships)

### Recommendations for All:
1. Reduce screen time to 4-5 hours/day
2. Establish regular sleep schedule (7-8 hours)
3. Practice mock interviews weekly
4. Start daily placement preparation
5. Build confidence through small wins

## Training Data Quality

**Coverage:**
- ✅ Academic range: 7.1 - 8.6 GPA
- ✅ Behavioral diversity: Study hours 3-4h, Screen time 5-6h
- ✅ Skills variation: Projects 3-5, Problem-solving 2-4/5
- ✅ Mental states: Confidence 1-3/5, Career clarity 2-4/5

**Limitations:**
- ⚠️ Small sample size (4 students) - need 50-100 for production
- ⚠️ All same major (CS) - need diversity for other majors
- ⚠️ All same semester (7) - need different years
- ⚠️ All not placed - need placed students for validation

**Recommendations:**
1. Collect 50-100 more students for better accuracy
2. Include different majors (ECE, Mechanical, etc.)
3. Include placed students to validate predictions
4. Include students from different semesters (3-8)

## Expected Model Capabilities

After training on this data, the LLM will be able to:

✅ **Parse student profiles** - Extract and understand all data fields
✅ **Calculate trajectory scores** - Apply optimal formulas correctly
✅ **Identify patterns** - Recognize strengths and weaknesses
✅ **Generate recommendations** - Provide actionable, specific advice
✅ **Predict outcomes** - Estimate placement likelihood
✅ **Project future** - Calculate 30-day trajectory changes

⚠️ **Limitations with 4 students:**
- May overfit to these specific patterns
- Limited generalization to very different profiles
- Needs more data for edge cases
- Cannot validate against actual placements

## Next Steps

1. **Run training** - Use `quick_start_training.bat`
2. **Test model** - Verify it produces similar outputs
3. **Collect more data** - Aim for 50-100 students
4. **Retrain** - Improve accuracy with larger dataset
5. **Validate** - Compare predictions to actual placements
6. **Deploy** - Integrate into your application

## Files Generated

After running the training pipeline:

1. **training_data.jsonl** - 4 training examples in JSONL format
2. **training_data_summary.md** - Human-readable summary with scores
3. **Modelfile** - Ollama model configuration
4. **trajectory-engine:latest** - Trained LLM model

## Usage Example

```bash
# Interactive testing
ollama run trajectory-engine:latest

# Then paste a student profile and get analysis
```

```python
# Programmatic usage
from integration_example import TrajectoryEngineLLM

llm = TrajectoryEngineLLM()
analysis = llm.analyze_student(student_data)
print(f"Score: {analysis['trajectory_score']}")
```
