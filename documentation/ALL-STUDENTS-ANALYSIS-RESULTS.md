## Ranking Analysis

### Expected Ranking (Calculated)
1. Sudeep: 0.738 (Strong study habits compensate for lower GPA)
2. Arun: 0.687 (Strong academics + projects)
3. Vivek: 0.682 (Upward GPA trend + projects)
4. Mayur: 0.631 (Low confidence is blocker)

### LLM Ranking (Tested)
1. Arun: 0.73 (Moderate-High likelihood)
2. Vivek: 0.62 (Low-Moderate likelihood)
2. Mayur: 0.62 (Moderate likelihood)

### Key Differences
- **Vivek vs Mayur:** LLM gave same score (0.62) but different likelihood
  - Vivek: Low-Moderate (30-50%) - behavioral issues
  - Mayur: Moderate (45-55%) - confidence issues but better academics

---

## Critical Findings

### Mayur's Confidence Issue
The LLM correctly identified Mayur's **confidence score of 1/5** as a critical blocker:
- "His confidence score is low (1/5)"
- "Confidence and interview fear" listed as top improvement area
- Recommended: "Practice mock interviews, work on building self-confidence"

This matches the calculated data showing Mayur has the lowest trajectory score primarily due to low confidence affecting his skills component.

### Vivek's Mobile Overconsumption
The LLM identified Vivek's self-reported blocker:
- "His blockers (mobile overconsumption) should be addressed"
- Recommended: "Implementing screen time tracking apps or setting boundaries"

### Arun's Consistency Gap
The LLM caught Arun's self-assessed weakness:
- "Consistency in problem-solving (self-assessed weakness)"
- Problem-solving score: 2/5 (lowest among all students)
- Recommended: "Develop problem-solving consistency through dedicated practice"
