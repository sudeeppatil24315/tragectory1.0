Generic single-database configuration for Trajectory Engine MVP.

This directory contains Alembic migration scripts for managing database schema changes.

## Quick Start

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. Generate a new migration (after changing models.py):
   ```bash
   alembic revision --autogenerate -m "Description of changes"
   ```

3. Apply migrations:
   ```bash
   alembic upgrade head
   ```

4. Rollback one migration:
   ```bash
   alembic downgrade -1
   ```

5. Check current version:
   ```bash
   alembic current
   ```

6. View migration history:
   ```bash
   alembic history
   ```

## Important Notes

- Always review auto-generated migrations before applying them
- Test migrations on development database first
- Backup production database before applying migrations
- The database URL is configured in alembic.ini and can be overridden by .env file
